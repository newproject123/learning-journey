Scenario:

There’s an island with 100 perfectly logical people. Some have blue eyes, and some have brown eyes. Everyone can see everyone else’s eye color but does not know their own.

The island’s rule says: If you ever find out your eye color, you must leave the island at midnight the same day.

No one talks about eye color, and no one gives any clues.

One day, an outsider comes and announces publicly: “At least one person here has blue eyes.”

Question: What happens next? When and how do the blue-eyed people leave?

solution - recursive deduction, everyone realizes that they have blue eyes and leave the island B days after realizing
